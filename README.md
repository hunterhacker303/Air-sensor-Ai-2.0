🚀 Problem Statement (The Real One)

Air pollution is not abstract. It kills silently, degrades productivity, and worsens chronic disease—especially in Indian cities where AQI monitoring is sparse, delayed, and reactive.

Most existing systems:

Report past data, not future risk

Are expensive and not scalable

Don’t translate AQI into actionable insights

AirSense AI fixes that.

💡 Solution Overview

AirSense AI is a low-cost, real-time air quality sensing and AI-powered prediction system that:

Continuously monitors environmental parameters

Predicts upcoming air quality trends using ML

Converts raw sensor data into clear health-focused insights

This is not just a sensor project.
It’s a decision system.

🧠 Key Features

📡 Real-Time Air Quality Monitoring
Measures gases and environmental parameters continuously via IoT sensors.

🤖 AI-Based AQI Prediction
Uses historical + live data to forecast pollution levels before they spike.

📊 Visual Dashboard
Clean graphs and AQI indicators for instant understanding.

⚠️ Health Risk Alerts
Warns users when conditions become unsafe—before damage occurs.

💰 Low-Cost & Scalable
Designed for mass deployment, not lab demos.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Hardware

ESP32 Microcontroller

Air Quality Sensor (MQ series / equivalent)

Temperature & Humidity Sensor

Software

Python (Data Processing & ML)

Machine Learning (Regression / Time-Series Forecasting)

Web Dashboard (HTML/CSS/JS or Flask)

Cloud / Local Server Integration

🧪 How It Works (Simple, Not Dumbed Down)

Sensors capture real-time air parameters

ESP32 transmits data wirelessly

Backend cleans and stores the data

ML model predicts future AQI trends

Dashboard displays insights + alerts

No unnecessary complexity. Every component earns its place.

📈 Why This Project Stands Out (Judge Perspective)

✅ Solves a real, measurable problem

✅ Uses AI for prediction, not decoration

✅ Hardware + Software integration

✅ Clear scope for real-world deployment

✅ Affordable and scalable design

Most hackathon projects die after demos.
This one can be installed tomorrow.
